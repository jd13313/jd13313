## WordPress

You may notice that some of these site's codebases are a little messy and not very consistent. The reason for this is that they were all built over a 5 year period during which my understanding of PHP and WP development was rapidly improving. Early sites were pretty standard WP themes done in the traditional manner, while later sites were built with a custom starter theme that utilized twig to introduce some basic OOP practices to theme development. 

### Jagger James Salon

This website was built to be a single page site with a few separate pages. The client wanted as much of their info immediately available to their customers as possible. This was handled with a single query that pulled in all pages marked for "one_page_view". If I were to do this site now, I'd probably just go with a VueJS frontend and use the WP REST API to pull in the pages.
